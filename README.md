# Economic-variable-correlation-and-productivity-model


## INTRODUCTION
Understanding the intricate relationships between key economic variables is crucial for policymakers, investors, and economists. These variables often provide insights into the health and dynamics of an economy, enabling more informed decisions. In the context of Nigeria, a nation with a rapidly evolving economic landscape, analyzing the interactions between the money supply (M1), real exchange rate (black market), stock market performance, and inflation rate is particularly relevant.
This report aims to delve into these relationships, providing a comprehensive analysis that spans several decades. By examining historical data from 1960 to 2024, we can identify trends, correlations, and potential causative factors influencing Nigeria's economic performance. The ultimate goal is to construct a productivity model that incorporates these variables, offering a theoretical and practical framework for understanding and predicting economic behavior.

## OBJECTIVE:
Perform a financial analysis to examine the correlations between key economic variables.

DATA COLLECTION
For this analysis, we have collected data on key economic variables for Nigeria spanning from 1960 to 2024. The data includes:
M1 Money Supply
Real Exchange Rate (Black Market)
Stock Market Performance
Inflation Rate
The dataset covers a sufficient time span to analyze trends and correlations, giving us insights into how these variables interact over time.


CORRELATION ANALYSIS
Visualization
To understand the relationships between the variables, we will plot them line charts and combo charts. Below are the charts for each pair of variables:
